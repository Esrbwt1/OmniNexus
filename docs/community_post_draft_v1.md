Subject: Seeking Feedback: OmniNexus - An Open, Privacy-First Framework for Personal AI & Data Integration

Hi everyone,

I'm exploring an idea and have built an early-stage proof-of-concept (PoC) for a project called OmniNexus, and I'd love to get some feedback from the community, especially on the core architecture and protocol design.

The Problem: Our digital lives are fragmented across countless services (email, cloud, notes, etc.). This makes holistic information access difficult and limits the potential for truly *personalized* AI assistants that understand our individual context. Current solutions often rely on centralizing data, raising privacy and control concerns.

The Vision: OmniNexus aims to be an open-source, decentralized, privacy-preserving framework allowing users to:
1.  Integrate disparate data sources via standardized "Connectors" (without central data ingestion).
2.  Orchestrate AI "Agents" (from simple automators to complex models) that operate on this integrated data under user control.
3.  Prioritize Privacy: User data stays local or under user control; AI comes *to* the data.

The goal is to create a foundational layer – a "Personal Cognitive Fabric" – enabling a future of user-sovereign, personalized AI.

Current PoC Status (Python):
*   Command-line interface (basic orchestration).
*   Local cryptographic identity (password protected).
*   Modular architecture with base classes for Connectors and Agents.
*   Factory pattern for component instantiation.
*   Connectors: Local Files (working), IMAP (skeleton).
*   Agents: Word Count, Keyword Extraction (naive).
*   Standardized internal data item structure.
*   Code & initial docs on GitHub: [https://github.com/Esrbwt1/OmniNexus](https://github.com/Esrbwt1/OmniNexus) *(Link to the actual repo)*

Seeking Feedback On:
*   Core Concept: Does the idea of a decentralized, privacy-first integration/orchestration layer resonate? Is this a problem worth solving this way?
*   Architecture: Any initial thoughts on the modular approach (Connectors, Agents, Datastore, Identity)? Obvious flaws or alternative designs?
*   Protocol Ideas: The current "protocol" is just the Python interfaces and data structure ([docs/protocol/data_item_structure.md](https://github.com/Esrbwt1/OmniNexus/blob/main/docs/protocol/data_item_structure.md)). How could this be formalized effectively for interoperability and security? (e.g., Schema definitions? Local API standards? Use of DIDs/VCs for permissions?)
*   Security/Privacy: Given the goal, what are the most critical security/privacy aspects to focus on next? (Beyond the obvious need for robust encryption everywhere).
*   Feasibility: What are the biggest technical hurdles you foresee?

Disclaimer: This is very early stage. The current PoC lacks robust security, error handling, many features, etc. It's primarily to illustrate the concept and architecture.

I'm building this primarily with sweat equity and learning as I go. Any constructive feedback, critique, or pointers towards relevant technologies/approaches would be incredibly valuable.

Thanks for reading!
